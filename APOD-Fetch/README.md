# CS472 (WAP): Astonomy Picture of the Day Lab (Fetch Verson)


## Intro :sunglasses:

In this programming Lab, you will extend the Astronomy Picture of the Day web site given in the AJAX lecture slides to include a title along with the picture.
This one uses fetch in place of Ajax.


## Features :star:

- input box for selecting date
- on select date and view, the image of the day is fetched and displayed.
- if error occurs, display it in a div rather than the alert box.


## Hosted on Github Pages :octocat:
